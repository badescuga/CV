## Short CV

I started my career working as a Platform Architect (C# .NET 4) for Alpha Bank where I developed an internal system distributed across the country.

I switched to mobile app development on iOS (Objective-C) & Windows Phone (C#/Silverlight), where I delivered more than a dozen apps to UK/US customers.

Afterwards, I went into developing games for Android/iOS/WP. I've worked both native (C#/XNA & Objective-C/Cocos2D) & cross-platform (C#/Unity3d). Been on Unity3d mostly for the last 4 years. My most recent project is Age of Lords. http://www.ageoflords.com/. It has grossed more than 4 million players on both iOS & Android. I was one of the 2 front-ends on the project, but also liked to mess around in the backend (NodeJS & Pomelo). 

I also co-founded a San Francisco start-up where I was a full-stack developer/CTO (NodeJS & Swift).

I worked as an Azure Web Apps Developer Support Engineer @ Microsoft where I helped programmers who struggle with implementing solutions in Azure. Here I learned a great deal about service infrastructure and how to manage your application development from start to finish. I also made my debut as a speaker as I hosted a webinar on NodeJS/Azure Web Apps for Microsoft. I'm also a contributor for project Kudu (the portal for SCM on Azure Web Apps). 

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer 2 @ Microsoft Norway. I'm working in the Office People team and striving to deliver a better people experience cross-product for all Microsoft Office web apps for business and consumer users.
